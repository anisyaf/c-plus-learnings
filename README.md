# c++ learnings

Welcome to **c++ learnings**, a personal collection of C++ scripts from my earliest programming experiences during coursework, exam practice, and self-study. C++ was the first language I learned, and these scripts demonstrate my foundational understanding of this programming language including control structures, functions, arrays, and practical problem-solving.

## Contents

- **Tuition Fee Calculator** ‚Äì Calculates tuition fees based on credit hours and program type using conditionals and functions.
- **Credit Hour Summation** ‚Äì Uses arrays and loops to process credit hours across multiple subjects.
- **Student Info Input** ‚Äì String input handling using `cin.getline()` and basic input validation logic.
- üîÅ More scripts to be added as I review and revisit past projects.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a personal archive of early programming work to look back at my first steps into coding. While these may appear simple, they reflect:
- My problem-solving approach
- My adherence to C++ syntax and logic
- My early code structuring habits
